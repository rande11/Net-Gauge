# Net-Gauge 

**Ok, at the moment this program does not work yet.** I am in the middle of creating a whiptail menu system that will allow easier entry of wan, lan, and user data.

Before I started using github, my verioning had gone to v2.2.4a. Below I will list all major and minor changes. Obviously this is not ready for release still being  in alpha.

I will explain how it works in later versions.
